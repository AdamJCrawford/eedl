What is eedl?
==============

eedl combines the functionality of what normally would take several packages into one. This makes working with eedl easier and more consistent that when working with other modules.

====================
How to install eedl
====================

Currently eedl can only be installed from the `GitHub repository`_. Distribution through PyPI and Conda-Forge are, hopefully, soon to come.
