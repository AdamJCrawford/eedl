What is EEDL?
==============

eedl combines the functionality of what normally would take several packages into one. This makes working with eedl easier and more consistent that when working with other modules.

====================
How to install EEDL
====================

Currently EEDL can only be installed from the `GitHub repository`_. Distribution through PyPI (i.e. via pip) and Conda Forge are coming soon.
